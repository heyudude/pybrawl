      summary: Search clubs
      description: >
        Search all clubs by name and/or filtering the results using various criteria. At least one filtering criteria must be defined and if name is used as part of search, it is required to be at least three characters long.

        It is not possible to specify ordering for results so clients should not rely on any specific ordering as that may change in the future releases of the API.
